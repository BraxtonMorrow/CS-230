CS 230 Project to display skills
This project was designed for the company The Gaming Room, they had initially created a game on an android environment, and then have it ported over to a PC environment, and potentially be available on other platforms later. In developing this application, I personally feel I had a huge understanding when it came to selecting operating systems for the server, and client-side info etc. I have run a computer business for fun on the side the last couple years, so I have a vast knowledge of the inner workings of a PC, and how it all works together etc. It was hard for me to find an area to improve, however I do feel my table needs some more data in the information. It is very important when it comes to the users needs to consider them, they are the entire reason you are designing the software to begin with, it must meet most if not all of their needs (as some needs may not be possible always in conjuncture with others, however its usually possible, good developers make it happen). My usual approach for assignments like this is to take the requirements line per line, analyze them and then code each piece separately then implement them together.
